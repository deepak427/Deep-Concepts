## 📚 **Learning Modules**

### 1. 💾 **Bits vs Qubits** (Foundation)
**Location**: Entry Island  
**Interactive**: `BitsVsQubitsDemo`  
**Key Concepts**:
- Classical bits: definite states (0 or 1)
- Quantum qubits: superposition states
- Measurement collapse
- No-cloning theorem

**Why First**: Students need to understand the fundamental difference between classical and quantum information before diving into quantum phenomena.

### 2. 🌊 **Superposition Island** 
**Interactive**: `WaveInterference`  
**Key Concepts**:
- Wave interference patterns
- Constructive/destructive interference
- Probability amplitudes
- How superposition creates quantum advantage

**Why Second**: After understanding qubits can be in superposition, students learn HOW superposition works through wave mechanics.

### 3. 🔮 **Entanglement Valley**
**Interactive**: `EntanglementDemo`  
**Key Concepts**:
- Bell states creation
- Quantum correlations
- Spooky action at a distance
- Myth vs reality about entanglement

**Why Third**: Entanglement builds on superposition - you need multiple qubits in superposition to create entangled states.

**Interactive**: `CircuitBuilder`  
**Key Concepts**:
- Quantum gates (X, H, Z, CNOT)
- Circuit construction
- Gate sequences
- Creating superposition and entanglement with gates

**Why Fourth**: Now students learn how to CONTROL and MANIPULATE quantum states using gates and circuits.

**Key Concepts**:
- Quantum algorithms
- Amplitude amplification
- Quantum speedup (O(√N) vs O(N))
- Classical vs quantum performance

**Why Fifth**: Students apply their knowledge of gates and circuits to see how quantum algorithms achieve speedup.

---

### 6. ❄️ **Cryogenic Caverns**
**Interactive**: `DilutionFridge` + `DecoherenceLab`  
**Key Concepts**:
- Why extreme cooling is needed
- Decoherence and noise
- Physical hardware challenges
- Temperature stages in quantum computers

**Why Last**: Students understand the practical challenges of building real quantum computers and why the theory is hard to implement.
